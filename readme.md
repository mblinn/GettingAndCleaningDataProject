#Overview
This repo contains a solution to the course project for Coursera's [Getting And Cleeaning Data](https://class.coursera.org/getdata-013) project.

The script `run_analysis.R` can be run in RStudio by cloning this repo, setting the repo directory as RSutdio's working directory, importing `run_analysis.R` and sourcing it.  The script `run_analysis.R` assumes that the `plyr` packages is already installed in your R environment.  When run, it will write a file named `averages_data.txt`, containing a data frame with averages computed as per the project description.

All original source data, along with its codebook, is included in this repo in the directory UCI\_HAR\_DATASET.
